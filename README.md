# flutter_bloc_example

A small demo app for explaining Streams / Sinks / StreamControllers / StreamBuilders / RxDarts BehaviorSubject and combining them into a simple BLoC for explaining the BLoC pattern.

This app was explained in detail during a MeetUp presentation, but the git-history and code-comments should suffice for understanding the concepts.
